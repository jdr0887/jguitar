      <subsection name="Can jobs be exported to LSF/SGE/PBS/SLURM?">
	<p>Yes and no.  HTCondor manages execution of jobs within a
	directed acyclic graph (DAG).  If the batch scheduler supports
	DAG job types, then it is possible.  For example, LSF can have
	the "name" of a job specified as a dependency...allowing a
	chaining of the vertexes of the graph by a parent/child
	relationship.  All LSF jobs would then be submitted
	simultaneously, but the child jobs would not execute until the
	parent job, by name, completed.  Not all common batch
	schedulers support this feature.</p>
